This spell plays havoc with electronic devices, making the use of such devices all but impossible. Each electronic device in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range is subject to random behavior while it remains within the area. A device not held by a creature is automatically affected. If an electronic device is held by a creature, that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the device affected by the spell.

At the start of each of your turns, roll a d6 for each affected device to determine its behavior. Except where otherwise indicated, that behavior lasts until the start of your next turn while this spell is in effect.

 d6   | Effect                                               

------+------------------------------------------------------

  1   | The device shuts down and must be restarted. Do not  

      | roll again for this device until it is restarted.    

------+------------------------------------------------------

2 - 4 | The device does not function.

  5   | The device experiences a power surge, causing an     

      | electric shock to the wielder (if any) and one random

      | creature within 5 feet of the device. Each affected  

      | creature must make a Dexterity saving throw against  

      | your spell save DC, taking 6d6 lightning damage on a 

      | failed save, or half as much damage on a successful  

      | one.                                                 

------+------------------------------------------------------

  6   | The device is usable as normal.
