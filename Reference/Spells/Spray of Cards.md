You spray spectral cards from your hands or sleeve; the cards blind or slash at your enemies, and then vanish. Choose one of the following effects for the cards.

**Blinding Cards**: Each creature in a 15-foot cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be blinded until the end of their next turn.

**Cutting Cards**: Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d10 force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of cutting cards increases by 1d10 for every two slot levels above 2nd.
