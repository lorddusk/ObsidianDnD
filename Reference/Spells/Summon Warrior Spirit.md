___
You call forth a warrior spirit from the legendary Deck of Many Things. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Warrior Spirit stat block. When you cast the spell, choose a type of warrior: barbarian, fighter, or monk. The warrior resembles a humanoid armed appropriately to the chosen class, which determines certain traits in its stat block. The warrior disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The warrior is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the warrior shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the creature assumes the higher level for that casting wherever it uses the spell's level in its stat block.
