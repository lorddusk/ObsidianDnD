#### Chaos Bolt (UA)
*1st-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
___
You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number it rolled determines the type of damage, as shown below.

**Chaos Bolt**

```

d8 | Damage Type

---+------------

1  | Acid       

---+------------

2  | Cold       

---+------------

3  | Fire       

---+------------

4  | Force      

---+------------

5  | Lightning  

---+------------

6  | Poison     

---+------------

7  | Psychic    

---+------------

8  | Thunder

```

If you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again. A creature can be targeted only once by this mass of chaotic energy.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, each target takes extra damage of the type rolled. The extra damage equals 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
