*2nd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (15 foot cone)
- **Components:** S, M (a vial of meltwater)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
___
A burst of icy cold energy emanates from you in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d8 cold damage and is covered in ice for 1 minute or until a creature uses its action to break the ice off itself or another creature. A creature covered in ice has its speed reduced to 0. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage with no additional effects.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, increase the cold damage by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
