#### Spirit of Death
*4th-level necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a gilded playing card depicting an avatar of death worth at least 400 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
___
You call forth a spirit that embodies death itself. Choose a creature you can see within range. The spirit manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within 10 feet of the target, and the target becomes haunted by the spirit. The spirit uses the Reaper Spirit stat block. The spirit disappears when it or the haunted creature is reduced to 0 hit points, or when the spell ends.

The reaper spirit is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you), but it will only attack the haunted creature. If you don't issue the spirit any commands, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell's level appears in the stat block.
