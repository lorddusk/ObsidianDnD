### Information

A wanderer in the shadows and the creator of snakes and serpentkin, Zehir is the evil god of poisons, assassins, and darkness. The ancient serpentkin worship him over all other deities, dragging screaming offerings to their temples in his honor. Most of the Cloaked Serpent's worshipers were annihilated during the Calamity, and the rest are either suspended in self-induced stasis or hunted for sport by the servants of Lolth and Torog. But perhaps Zehir is merely biding his time, waiting for the proper moment to unleash his hidden armies on the world once more.

Zehir subverts and poisons Exandria from the shadowed Towers of Night, hidden among the ever-shifting winds of the Astral Plane.

**Depiction**: Many forgotten temples were once built to the Cloaked Serpent, and within these chambers his image was embedded within much of the architecture. He is shown as a human body with six arms and a gargantuan serpentine head, fanged and frilled in aggression. Strands of thick, dark hair that sprout from his scaled body form layers of swirling shadow, obscuring his form.

**Enemies**: Zehir loathes Erathis and Melora, for he despises life, order, and love above all things. His surviving worshipers use poison and fire to undermine civilization and consume nature, hoping to infuriate both gods and cast Exandria into chaos.

**Commandments of Zehir**: - Keep your acts obfuscated and secret. The night is your greatest ally.

- Strike quickly and without reason. Blind the target with their own confusion.

- Kill slowly. Agonizingly. Or worse, make them enjoy it.
