### Information

Uk'otoa was created by Zehir and terrorized the seas of Wildemount until the Divergence left the leviathan without master or purpose. The surviving indigenous people of the Swavain Islands, the Ki'Nau, took Uk'otoa as their guide and god to rule the waters and bring them prosperity. The leviathan elevated the Ki'Nau to conquer the southern coasts of the continent until the jealous will of Zehir reached beyond the Divine Gate and discovered the insolence of his creation, commanding his followers to seal away Uk'otoa in the bedrock beneath the Lucidian Ocean.

Uk'otoa now reaches out to the dreams of nautical wanderers and shipwrecked sailors, lending his power to those who wish to rule the sea as he once did, beckoning them to free him from his suboceanic prison with promises of arcane gifts and the blessing of the blade known as the Sword of Fathoms, an extension of Uk'otoa's will and influence. His consciousness has found the minds of Desirat and Quajath, and the three have a tenuous accord to convince mortals to find and free them from their binds.

**Appearance**: Uk'otoa takes the form of an incredibly massive sea serpent. His coiled and twisting length is covered with fins, scales, and amber eyes, with a head ending in a pointed, fanged jaw and a face of three amber eyes.
