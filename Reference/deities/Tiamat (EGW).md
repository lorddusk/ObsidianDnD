### Information

The evil queen of dragons is a fearsome god of greed, envy, and hoarded wealth. While chromatic dragons are her foremost worshipers, Tiamat accepts the worship of any who crave wealth. All chromatic dragons have a fearful reverence for their tyrannical queen, but many dragons of near-deific power and ambition chafe under her rule.

Tiamat remains imprisoned in Avernus, the first of the Nine Hells, influencing the souls of chromatic dragons across the planes and seeking the means to free herself.

**Depiction**: Most representations of Tiamat exist as warnings within sanctuaries of the Platinum Dragon Bahamut. She is shown as a drake of frightful size, with massive leathery wings spreading clouds of poisonous mist, while she shouts from five vicious dragon heads, each one a chromatic color of her evil children.

**Enemies**: The Scaled Tyrant's hatred for Bahamut is as old as the Founding, and her cults are ever hunted by his justice. For centuries, the zealous paladins of Bahamut have limited her worship to the chromatic dragons, but a rise in cult activity in the underbelly of Dwendalian society has priests of the Platinum Dragon on edge.

**Commandments of Tiamat**: - Amass wealth, but spend little. The gold—and the power that comes with it—is sufficient reward in itself.

- Do not forgive nor forget an indignity to yourself. Let no affront go unpunished.

- Take what you covet. Those without the strength to defend their dominion are not worthy to have one.
