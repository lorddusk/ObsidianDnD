### Information

The lich lord Vecna presides over villainous mages, conspiring politicians, and envious servants as the dark god of necromancy, undeath, and secrets. Once a dangerously clever and powerful archmage-turned-lich, his hunger for dominion over all mysteries and obsession with conquering the pantheon led to his own dissolution, leaving behind only his left hand and eye. His enduring spirit reformed through the ages and managed to reconstruct the Raven Queen's rites of ascension to become the newest of gods to walk Exandria. Defeated by the legendary heroes Vox Machina and sealed behind the Divine Gate, the Whispered One now quietly rules over that which is not meant to be known.

Vecna calls no place among the planes his home, instead wandering in search of powerful artifacts and secrets to further his unknowable plots.

**Depiction**: Those who claim to have looked on Vecna's form speak of a tall, skeletal lich swathed in tattered robes and enchanted jewels, missing both his left hand and left eye.

**Enemies**: While Vecna loathes all other gods and wishes to destroy them and become the sole divine power in the planes, he has a particular hatred for Ioun. Ioun seeks to share with the world the same secrets Vecna guards for himself, and his followers work diligently to undermine and destroy the Library of the Cobalt Soul and any others who follow her path. The Raven Queen also despises Vecna, and sees his presence as a mighty affront to her purpose.

**Commandments of Vecna**: - Learn all you can, and keep hidden that which you know. Reveal what pieces you must, but never the whole.

- Express and cultivate the evil within yourself, and in doing so, recognize it in others to exploit them for your own benefit.

- Seed the ruin of all who worship other deities, until only those who kneel before Vecna remain.
