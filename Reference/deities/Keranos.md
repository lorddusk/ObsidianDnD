### Information

Keranos is the god of storms and wisdom. Merciless and impatient, Keranos is equally likely to strike out at mortals with a bolt of inspiration or a blast of lightning. To revere Keranos is to exult in the power of wisdom, clarity of purpose, and the fury of the storm. He is favored by tinkerers, inventors, and sailors as well as those seeking solutions to intractable problems. He doesn't tolerate the company (or the worship) of fools, and he despises vapidity and indecision.

Keranos rarely appears directly to mortals, preferring to communicate through an epiphany or a crashing bolt of lightning. When he does deign to manifest in the mortal world, Keranos prefers the form of a stout, bearded, male human wearing a purple loincloth girdled in a mithral chain belt with a clasp in the form of a dragon's skull. His bearing is upright and stern, with a clipped, brusque way of speaking. Particularly clever plans and observations bring a hint of a smile to his face. When interacting with mortals, Keranos sometimes appears in the form of a great horned owl with lightning strikes flashing in its eyes.

**Keranos's Influence**: Keranos is the embodiment of wisdom and insight unhindered by compassion or patience. Just as the storm vents its fury unpredictably and without warning, so does Keranos deliver the wisdom he chooses to impart.

A storm, for all its unpredictability, can still be weathered by those who apply foresight and knowledge. So it is when dealing with Keranos. He rewards those who act with forethought and decisiveness and punishes the reckless for their stupidity.

Those who seek to solve enigmas and create wonders of art and science often invoke his name. The creative process is fraught with frustration, and his insights make short work of such hindrances as easily as the lightning parts a mighty oak.

Keranos dispenses inspiration without regard for the morality of its application. He is just as likely to reward the shrewd general seeking to topple a polis as a gentle healer searching for a cure for a malady. Good and evil don't color his thinking, only action and the thrill of birthing new ideas into the world. Furthering the act of creating�be it ideas, weapons, art, or magic�is what matters most.

**Keranos's Goals**: For good or ill, Keranos exists as a disruptive force. He doesn't desire authority over other gods and, in fact, doesn't particularly enjoy their company. Keranos finds satisfaction in investing bright mortals with prescient visions to see how they adapt. Those who prove themselves decisive and intelligent, such as the missing Queen Cymede of Akros, earn his grudging respect and continued blessings of precognition. He finds satisfaction not only in granting insight, but also in expressing the awesome fury of the storm. Where others see only chaos and destruction in storms, he sees them as shaping the firmament in ways that challenge and engage mortals. His blasts of lightning set house and forest ablaze, thus rendering the soil clear for new life and new creations. His is a vision he alone is equipped to see. He is content to watch his divine kinfolk scheme and plot while he looks on, stern and inscrutable.

**Divine Relationships**: Keranos is neither friendly nor sociable, so his dealings with most of the rest of the pantheon tend to be terse, formal, and brief. This doesn't mean that no interactions of note take place, however.

Of all the gods, Thassa has the most cordial relationship with Keranos. He enjoys the sea god's love of ancient lore, introspection, and complex patterns. The two sometimes talk for days at a time debating the flaws in ancient sophistries and discussing the meaning of the stars. Thassa, imperturbable and constant, makes the ideal counter to the wise yet temperamental Keranos.

Another interesting relationship exists with Purphoros. The passions of the divine blacksmith run hot, as does the need to create. The melding of Keranos's inspiration with Purphoros's passion is a formidable combination. This partnership resulted in the creation of Epiphany, Keranos's mighty javelin.

**Worshiping Keranos**: Keranos's name is often invoked by those amid a storm who seek safety, or by someone who is faced with a particularly difficult problem. Only the foolhardy call out to Keranos frivolously or in jest, since he might well smite the offender with a bolt from the blue.

In Akros, where Queen Cymede actively promoted the worship of Keranos, elaborate ceremonies are conducted beginning just before the first summer thunderstorm. Intricate, open-framed sand paintings with complex geometric shapes are created by dancers in flowing blue silken wraps. Then, as the rains fall, the paintings are washed away, symbolizing the impermanence of genius and the power of change. Akroan oracles strive to predict the exact time of the first storm in hopes of allowing enough time to stage the celebration. A similar festival in Meletis, called the Lightning Festival, gives its name (Astrapion) to the third month of the year.

On the last day of every month, Keranos's priests and laity bring offerings of fish and distilled spirits to his temples. The fish are cooked under a skylight open to the stars, with a shot of spirits thrown on the fire.

**Keranos's Champions**: **Alignment**: Usually chaotic, often neutral

**Suggested Classes**: Barbarian, bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, wizard

**Suggested Cleric Domains**: Knowledge, Tempest

**Suggested Backgrounds**: Acolyte, entertainer, guild artisan, noble, sage, sailor

Most champions of Keranos are calm under pressure, creative, and clever. They often seek to challenge the status quo and thrill at wielding the power of the storm.

**Keranos's Favor**: Keranos chooses champions who are deliberate and wise, yet able to bring the storm's fury when needed. He expects his champions to be aggressive and self-reliant and disdains the lazy and the foolish, who deserve whatever ill fortune befalls them.

The god of storms is inscrutable at the best of times; thus, it can be difficult to discern why you've earned his favor. What prompted him to gift you with foreknowledge of important events? How have you demonstrated your potential? The Keranos's Favor table offers a handful of suggestions.
