### Information

Purphoros is the god of the forge, the restless earth, and fire. He rules the raw creative force that infuses sapient minds. Purphoros is also the god of artisans, obsession, and the cycle of creation and destruction.

As a forge radiates heat in the area around it, Purphoros's influence provides inspiration to mortals. He makes exquisitely crafted objects almost constantly, sometimes absentmindedly working while he holds conversations with the other gods, only to destroy the finished product and begin again. Impulsive and mercurial, Purphoros is prone to bouts of either joyous productivity or frustrated anger. He often feels constrained by the limits of imagination, yearning to realize ideas that seem just out of reach.

Purphoros's preferred form is that of a muscular man whose coal-hued skin is mostly covered in mutable organic bronze. He might also appear in the form of a fiery phoenix or a bull made of cooling lava, and for that reason, both of those creatures are associated with him. When angered, he might appear as an enormous mass of lava, a blazing fire, or a volcanic eruption. Mortals who see Purphoros in one of those forms seldom live to tell about it.

**Purphoros's Influence**: The raw creative force that Purphoros embodies is chaotic, but Purphoros isn't a god of unbridled chaos. Rather, he shows mortals how to harness that primal energy, shaping it through passion and labor into something usable.

Purphoros is primarily associated with forging, metallurgy, and related activities. It was his followers who first brought bronze to Theros, and a few of his most favored have begun working with a new metal�iron�said to come directly from their god's forge-fires.

Though Purphoros is largely interested in physical craft, he has influence over all forms of creation. Keranos also inspires new ideas, but it is Purphoros who oversees the advancement of the craft that brings these ideas to life in the world.

Purphoros is always ready to obliterate what is to make room for what could be, and to start the cycle again when what could be becomes what is. When he is inspired, the night sky glitters with new constellations, and anvilwrought creatures appear in the countryside. When he is wrathful, stars vanish in molten rain, and his hammer blows annihilate whole mountaintops.

**Purphoros's Goals**: Purphoros acts not because of grand plans or high ideals, but on the whims of his restless, creative mind. On the rare occasions when he contemplates what he would do if he were ascendant in the pantheon, his most fervent wish is to be left alone. To Purphoros, that would mean spending time by himself in his forge, creating anything he desires. But it also would mean being free to uproot mountains, topple cities, and reroute rivers without any of the other gods interfering.

**Divine Relationships**: Purphoros has few strong relationships with his fellow gods, considering most of them arrogant ingrates. According to legend, it was he who created the weapons of the gods, asking nothing in return. But his infrequent though memorable bouts of destructive fury have earned him more ill will in the pantheon than he realizes.

Heliod despises Purphoros's unpredictable impulses even as he envies the forge god's ability to create grand works. Purphoros resents Heliod's attempts to impose laws that constrain the passion of creation. In many ways, the two gods represent opposing approaches to the contradictions and challenges of mortal life, and they have more than once fought titanic battles in Nyx.

Thassa is Purphoros's closest ally in the pantheon. Imbued as she is with the malleable, quenching power of water, she knows that he can neither destroy her waves nor reforge them. Because she has no fear of him, she treats him as a friend. Purphoros frequently makes wondrous gifts for Thassa, and her underwater palace holds countless unique creations of the god of the forge.

Purphoros holds Kruphix in contempt for hobbling his mind after he engaged in a particularly destructive battle with Heliod. The forge god spent years addled and incomplete. He has since recovered his faculties, but he mourns the things he might have made during that lost time. Taking revenge on Kruphix would require careful planning, however, and Purphoros is unlikely to undertake such an effort unless another god goads him into it.

Ephara and Karametra are, like Purphoros, deeply involved in the project of civilization. Purphoros's desire to overturn the established order with violence stands in stark contrast to their measured ways. As a result, Purphoros stands aloof from them.

**Worshiping Purphoros**: Purphoros holds dominion over everything that springs from mortal ingenuity. Most artisans say a small prayer to him upon beginning or completing the construction of nearly anything, from swords to fortresses to ships.

Naturally, Purphoros is strongly associated with the forge, and nearly every smithy on Theros is a sort of ad hoc temple to him. Charms and idols of Purphoros hang from the walls in such places, intended both to inspire the artisans and protect them against accidents. Regardless of their professions, worshipers of Purphoros often light small fires in the god's honor, burning wooden crafts or drawings of their inventions to gain his favor.

**Purphoros's Champions**: **Alignment**: Usually chaotic, often neutral

**Suggested Classes**: Barbarian, bard, cleric, fighter, sorcerer

**Suggested Cleric Domains**: Forge (described in Xanathar's Guide to Everything), Knowledge

**Suggested Backgrounds**: Acolyte, entertainer, guild artisan

Most champions of Purphoros are unswerving advocates of passion and creativity who change the world by doing what they believe is right in the moment.

**Purphoros's Favor**: Purphoros is notoriously impulsive, often selecting champions based on momentary whims. Despite this seemingly blas� attitude, he is dedicated to all his champions, no matter how they came into his service.

What made the forge god turn his attention to you? What set you apart from the masses of people who offer him prayers and sacrifice? What whim came over him that made you the perfect choice in the moment he tapped you? The Purphoros's Favor table offers a handful of suggestions.

Purphoros's mood is highly changeable, and having his favor doesn't always mean having his attention. But if you follow your passions and do what you believe is right, he will stay true to you as well.
