- **Symbol:** Jeweled spider
### Information

The evil god of deceit, shadows, and spiders, Lolth weaves a complicated web of schemes and treachery through her worshipers, deceiving allies and enemies alike to gain power. It is said that the Spider Queen can see through the eyes of all spiders, and that she is truly all-knowing. Lolth's worship is entwined with the society of dark elves across much of Exandria, but she has lost her influence in Wildemount since the Calamity, when her drow rejected her in favor of the ancient entity known as the Luxon. This slight has drawn her venomous hatred, and she now seeks vengeance against those who betrayed her.

Lolth sends forth her corrupting poisons and whispers from her realm of the Demonweb, which is tethered to the Abyss and home to her many spider children.

**Depiction**: Many Lolthite icons and idols show an alluring woman with dark purple skin and silver hair, her abdomen swelling into the terrifying body of a monstrous spider.

**Enemies**: Lolth holds a searing grudge against Kord, the Storm Lord, for with one throw of his mighty thunderspear he impaled her against a cliffside, leaving her drow armies leaderless during the Calamity. Lolth and Gruumsh also share a burning hatred for Corellon, whom she claims drove her children below the earth, and Lolth often manipulates Gruumsh's followers into attacking her enemies so that the drow may remain safe. While Lolth cannot sense the will or power of the Luxon, the entity that is now worshiped by the dark elves of Xhorhas, she is bent entirely toward the destruction of its followers and their memory.

**Commandments of Lolth**: - It is better to be loved than feared, but you may certainly try to be both.

- Misdirection, slander, and shadowed steps have more function than direct conflict.

- Death to the elves who live under the sun, and death to all their allies!
