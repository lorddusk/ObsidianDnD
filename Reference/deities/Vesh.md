### Information

None know whether Vesh is a witch or a demigod, but she has walked Exandria for centuries, seducing those who pry into forbidden magics and drawing them to her as possible suitors. Acolytes cultivate sects of worshipers who engage in ritualistic orgies and masochistic rites, these hedonistic rituals culminating with her selection of a mate. Vesh feeds on the unchosen in a bloody massacre before laying with her selected survivor and vanishing to her realm. Their essences intertwined, she then lends her strength to her mate, watching over them for life.

A being with conflicting duality, Vesh has moods that demand sacrifice and pain, and others that ask for benevolence and mercy. Because Vesh's whims are truly unknown, many who wish to gain her favor and attention commit terrible acts. While she has many partners, she is a jealous patron who demands the true heart of her chosen. Those who stray are never heard from again.

**Appearance**: Vesh resembles a nude woman with faintly glowing gray skin, long purple hair, and unnaturally long arms and fingers that end in claw-like nails. Her eyes are pale white with no iris, and her expression varies from alluring to monstrous depending on her mood.
