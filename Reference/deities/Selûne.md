### Information

Sel�ne is thought to be among the most ancient of Faer�n's deities. Most humans in Faer�n consider the moon in the sky to literally be the goddess gazing down on the world, and the trailing motes of light behind it her tears. She is also a goddess of stars and navigation as well as motherhood and reproductive cycles. She is seen as a calm power, frequently venerated by female humans as well as by a mix of other folk: navigators and sailors, those who work honestly at night, those seeking protection in the dark, the lost, and the questing.

There are many legends about Sel�ne, chief among them being the tale of the battle at the beginning of time between Sel�ne and her sister, Shar. The Tears of Sel�ne, the cluster of starry lights that follow the moon around the sky, are thought to be brought about by the goddess's joy, sorrow, or both.

Milk, a symbol of motherhood, is used in many rites performed by the worshipers of Sel�ne, as are trances and meditation. Those who favor her typically set a bowl of milk outside on each night of the full moon.
