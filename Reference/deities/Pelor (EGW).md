### Information

Pelor rules over sun and summer, his vigil encircling the ages as the keeper of time. As lord of agriculture and harbinger of the harvest, he is worshiped by farmers and most common folk, and his priests are welcomed in many lands. Supporter of the needy and destroyer of evil, the Dawn Father is often the patron of paladins and rangers who follow a similar creed. He is also known for his defeat of the Chained Oblivion and is revered by those who hunt aberrations.

Pelor is often found within the Fortress of the Sun, a shining, golden citadel that brings vibrant life to the limitless orchards of the Blessed Fields of Elysium.

**Depictions**: Tapestries of old match early texts describing Pelor as a paternal figure in silver and gold armor, his head a beacon of light and fire so bright that his face can barely be seen. Many statues in holy places use the head as a brazier, lit with each dawn and extinguished at dusk.

**Holy Day**: Pelor's holy day is called Highsummer, and takes place on the fifteenth day of the seventh month. While other parts of Exandria feast, the Dwendalian Empire uses this day as an opportunity to enlist more soldiers in its army. The military holds great feasts and hands out toy soldiers and other propaganda, encouraging people to enlist and help fight against the evil that threatens the king.

**Commandments of Pelor**: - Be ever vigilant for evil. People are quick to forget the lessons of the past.

- Help relieve the suffering of the innocent.

- Deliver the light of Pelor where darkness dwells, with kindness, compassion, and mercy.
