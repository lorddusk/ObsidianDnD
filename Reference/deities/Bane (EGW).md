### Information

Blood-drenched armies of brutal warriors oft crush their foes in the name of Bane, the evil patron of war and conquest. To serve his will is to accept the call to conflict, seeking lesser people to break and subjugate. Warmongering nations and goblinoid tribes worship the Strife Emperor as they strike out at the world to bend it beneath them. Bane twists all living things to his iron will, forcing even nature itself to bow to his whims.

Bane plots his conquest of the planes from within the bastion of Banehold, towering among the blood-soaked battlefields of Acheron.

**Depiction**: Bane is often depicted as a brutish, ogre-like man clad from head to toe in jagged black armor. Heads dangle from his belt, and the shadows that obscure his helmeted face do not hide his yellow eyes.

**Enemies**: The Strife Emperor's greatest enemy is Melora, who defeated him at Rifenmist during the Calamity. The Strife Emperor grew his armies by corrupting noble creatures into monsters and destroying the wilds to fuel his terrible engines of conflict, and the two deities clashed many times during the war before his defeat at Beynsfal Plateau.

**Commandments of Bane**: - Fear is your ally. Conquer your fear and inspire it in your foes.

- Disorder and rebellion are to be punished severely.

- Combat is the greatest gift, and perfecting your skills to master it is the greatest pursuit.
