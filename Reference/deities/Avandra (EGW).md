### Information

Also known as "She Who Makes the Path," Avandra champions freedom, travel, trade, and adventure across the lands. Her will heralds open frontiers, and her call beckons her followers to discover that which awaits them beyond the known. There are few urban temples dedicated to the Change Bringer, but her shrines are often found along well-traveled roads and off the beaten path. Her worship is common among merchants, free spirits, and adventurers, and tavern cheers celebrate her as a bringer of luck and fortune.

Avandra calls no domain in the planes her residence, instead eternally wandering through the Outer Planes where serenity can be found, distantly watching over the potential of mortals.

**Depiction**: The Change Bringer is often depicted as a young woman of dark complexion and long, light brown hair that cascades to form the road left behind her. Most art shows her in constant motion, ever leading into the unknown.

**Holy Day**: Avandra's holy day, called New Dawn, takes place on the first day of the first month, when the old year gives way to the new. On the Menagerie Coast, people celebrate by having a feast on the shore at dusk to watch the sunset. They feast and discuss their hopes for the new year until the sun rises.

**Commandments of Avandra**: - Luck favors the bold. Your fate is your own to grasp, and to do so is to have the Change Bringer behind you.

- Change is inevitable. The righteous can ensure that such change is for the better.

- Rise against tyranny. Fight for the freedom of yourself and others when you can, and inspire others to fight when you cannot.
