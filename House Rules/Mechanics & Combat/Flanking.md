*Flanking:* when a creature and at least one ally are within 5ft of the same enemy on opposite sides or corners of the enemyâ€™s space, they flank that enemy and each of them has advantage on melee attack rolls against that enemy. This does not take effect if that one ally is 5 ft from an enemy. ( 2v1 allows flanking, 2v2 does not )
