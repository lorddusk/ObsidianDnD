*Teamwork Initiative:* On the first turn of combat, allow players to lower their initiative to one point lower than that of an ally. this can allow for enhanced teamwork, cool combinations and interesting tactics.  
  
*Flanking:* when a creature and at least one ally are within 5ft of the same enemy on opposite sides or corners of the enemyâ€™s space, they flank that enemy and each of them has advantage on melee attack rolls against that enemy. This does not take effect if that one ally is 5 ft from an enemy. ( 2v1 allows flanking, 2v2 does not )

*Identification:* cast identify or have a (NPC) wizard identify them for you for a price. Using or attuning to unidentified magic items allow them to work as intended, you might just not recognize its effects.

*Skill usage:* Group checks require all heroes to roll and the majority must pass, critital 1 and 20 count as double.  
Party checks allow one player, the best trained PC to roll once. If a second PC is trained, they can assist for advantage. A third trained PC may add a +1 bonus. If the roll fails, it fails.
