# Alton Millbrooke 

```ad-ooc
collapse:closed
24 yo
from a farmers family
trouble avoidant
got lost into the feywild, doesn't remember much
Ran into several fey entities, one of them caused a shift in his personalty
Caused him to become more brash, not feel as homesick as much, and became more combatant
Spend around 2 years there
Has only been back a couple of years
To his surprise 47 years went by in his absence

```
