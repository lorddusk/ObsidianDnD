**Rules of Cool**

*Burgeoning Heroes:* Each character starts with 5 extra hit points.

*Vicious Mockery:* If the bard uses vicious mockery and their insult makes the DM laught, the target automatically fails their saving throw.

**Mechanics & Combat**

*Potions:* Drinking a potion is a bonus action, administering one is an action.

*Stealth:* Players roll (Dex) Stealth rolls only at the point of possible detection, when mentioned players want to go 'into stealth mode'. Rolls will be made when someone could see them or is looking for them.

*Heavy Critical Hits:* when you roll a natural 20 on an attack, roll your damage rolls, and add the maximum they could have rolled to that number.

*Exhausting Critical:* Characters can turn a hit into a critical by suffering 2 exhaustion levels. when a bossfight comes to the very end, both character and nemesis are wounded, tired and exhausted, you can exceed your limits to deliver a critical blow.

*Teamwork Initiative:* On the first turn of combat, allow players to lower their initiative to one point lower than that of an ally. this can allow for enhanced teamwork, cool combinations and interesting tactics.  
  
*Flanking:* when a creature and at least one ally are within 5ft of the same enemy on opposite sides or corners of the enemy’s space, they flank that enemy and each of them has advantage on melee attack rolls against that enemy. This does not take effect if that one ally is 5 ft from an enemy. ( 2v1 allows flanking, 2v2 does not )

*Identification:* cast identify or have a (NPC) wizard identify them for you for a price. Using or attuning to unidentified magic items allow them to work as intended, you might just not recognize its effects.

*Skill usage:* Group checks require all heroes to roll and the majority must pass, critital 1 and 20 count as double.  
Party checks allow one player, the best trained PC to roll once. If a second PC is trained, they can assist for advantage. A third trained PC may add a +1 bonus. If the roll fails, it fails.

**Inspiration**

*DM inspiration:** normally used to gain advantage on a roll before rolling.

  
**Party Inspiration:** Inspiration tokens are pooled for the party to a maximum of 4 tokens to stimulate the use of inspiration.

**Inspired saving throws:** players can spend their reaction and a point of inspiration to gain a saving throw reroll.

**"I have a thing for that":**  Allow a player to spend a point of inspiration to 'remember' their character purchased a mundane item. Gold is deducted as if the item was bought earlier and just lost it in their pack.
