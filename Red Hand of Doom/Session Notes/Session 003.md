# Summary of This Session:

Na een goede nachtrust zijn we bij Crucia geroepen, die ons wederom bedankte voor gisteravond.
Maar drukt ons op het hart dat er meer te doen is dan zo op het eerste gezicht lijkt. En vraagt ons om haar te volgen naar de achterkant van de inn. Hier staat een kar met een dode kobold erin, gemuteerd met insect dna. 
In haar kantoor legt ze uit wat zij denkt wat er aan de hand is. Een oude party genoot is aan het experimenteren om hun oude vrienden, die verdwenen zijn, terug te halen. Sinds 6 maanden zijn er rare mutaties geconstateerd in zowel groente/fruit en de insecten in de omgeving.
Wij besloten als groep om te helpen, en te onderzoeken wat het probleem kan zijn.
Ze geeft ons de informatie dat haar oude party genoot, Veshje, in de oude verlaten water molen zit ten noorden van het dorp, en dat daar ook een kobold nest is.
Na een dag reizen, en een nacht rusten komen wij hier aan, en besluiten om Keth en een vermomde Aelar te laten checken wat de situatie is in het nest/kamp.

## 1 Marpenoth

After breakfast, [[Crucia Cromwell]] approaches us. She thanks us again for our help, but fears there is more to it than meets the eye.
She says quietly, looking around the room for any eavesdroppers. Asks us to follow her outside, so she can show us something.
Moving around to the back of the inn. A hidden cart under a tarp, under the tarp is a dead, but weird kobold.
The kobold has antenna's, a chitin exoskeleton, and their eyes are insect-like faceted. [[Keth]] feels a taint-like demonic energy from this kobold, origination from the [[Gaping Maw]]. 
Earlier this morning another kobold, guards shot down another kobold (a scout most likely), which was riding on a wasp.

Over the last 10 days rumours have been spreading about villages being attacked up the riverside (up stream).
Following her to her office for more pressing information, scouts come up and tell her that a kobold nest was found up stream.
Village has no means to fight this nest. They think a much bigger attack will happen soon.

Since 6 months the harvest has been growing to abnormal sizes. They initially thought [[Chauntea]] was the cause of this, until the insects also started to grow, this was not an issue, until the wasps attacked. 
Her office is very comfortable, and is lighted by wall to wall windows, and custom made [[Driftglobe]]s.
A burned blue banner with a unicorn, made for an adventuring party, [[Knights of the Spiral Crown]]. 
A grey banner, which is Zhentarim made.  
She offers us whiskey, and I down it, while the rest of the party carefully tries to sniff it. 

[[Veshje]] has a hidden lab up north, an arcane artificer, his work has made [[Crucia Cromwell]] rich, and gave her a lot of influence.
If we want to help, we need to know more to increase our winning changes.
During their scouting, they woke a sleeping Mythal that was stuck in rock. 
They lost 3 party members during the scouting of a ruin in a teleporting accident, and decided to stop their adventuring.
[[Crucia Cromwell]] went further with her life, [[Veshje]] couldn't move on, and started to research a way to get their friends back, due to overwhelming guilt.

Crucia thinks Veshje is behind the increasing of vegetable sizes and insects.
She doesn't have the resources to send a group to check on Veshje.
She gives us 3 objectives, figure out the reason for the mutations, check on Veshje at the [[Old Abandoned Watermill]], and clear the Kobold Nest.

After asking her what it would get us. She gives a copper javelin to [[Keth]]. And a pouch of gold for the party as a down payment.
The assignment, has been shipped to [[Brindol]] to make it official. Giving quicker access to the guild for [[Bikam]], [[Aelar]], and [[Alton]] if they want it in the future.

Introduced ourselves to each other, as we only "met" last night.

Decided to do go to mill first, check on [[Veshje]], and finish the nest after.

Moving along the river, we see the mutations of the vegetables very quickly, and more often further along the river.
We meet a fey woman, azure blue skin, fallen in eyes, asks us for help as she fell into the river.
An oil like substance, originates from the old mill, according to her that is the origin of the mutation.
[[Keth]] casts Lay on Hands on her curing her of the poisonous state she is in. And gifts him a [[Fey enchanted drop of water]].

Near the mill, we decide to set up camp.
During the first watch, by [[Keth]] and [[Alton]], the trap that was set by [[Aelar]] was sprung. A massive spider (the size of a small dog) was caught in it.
During [[Booker]]'s watch (second) nothing was heard or seen.
During the watch of [[Aelar]] and [[Bikam]] also nothing happens.

## 2 Marpenoth

Waking up, and continuing our journey.
We see the old mill, next to the river. On the mill, charms and effigies are attached.
We hear voices/noises, carried by the wind, originating from the mill.

Next to the mill in a cornflower field, we spot a kobold camp, with a dozen or so huts and wood pulp.
We do reconnaissances and come up with a plan to get into the camp.

[[Aelar]] and [[Keth]] are going to go Orc and try to convince the kobolds to tell them what their plan is and who their boss is.

# Loot:
- [[Javelin of Lightning]] - Copper Javelin (Given to [[Keth]])
- Small pouch containing 3 [[Small Health Potion]]s
- [[Fey enchanted drop of water]] (Given to [[Keth]])
