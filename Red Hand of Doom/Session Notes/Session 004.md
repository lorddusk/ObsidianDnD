## 2 Marpenoth
[[Aelar]] and [[Keth]] walk into the [[Wretched Knife Camp]] and [[Keth]] notices traps around the bridge leading up to Point A (see map)
[[Booker]] and [[Alton]] await further implications in the nearby cornflowers. 
[[Keth]] tries to communicate with the 3 kobolds on guard, but fails miserably. One of the kobolds fires their bow.

```
After murdering a dozen or so kobolds we investigate the second island (Point B)
On this island the nest/hive lays, bones and feathers lay around
An attempt to make them look like houses was not very successful.
It has the size of a normal tavern.

A shed without door is open on the south-side of the hive. On the inside clay icons reside looking like wasp kobolds.
Several trinkets
Copper pots are connected with pipes, set up like distilling lab. It's filled with a thicker scarlet red liquid. On the edge of the basin has a written message. " Shrine to Demogorgon, the great changer."
This liquid is the origin of the changes, but in a very highly distilled version. [[Alton]] scoops up an amount in his waterskin.

[[Aelar]] tosses a torch in the hive, lighting it up.
[[Aelar]] and [[Keth]] carry the basin/copper pot towards the opening, and toss the pot in the opening of the hive, causing the liquid to ooze out.
