## 2 Marpenoth
[[Aelar]] and [[Keth]] walk into the [[Wretched Knife Camp]] and [[Keth]] notices traps around the bridge leading up to Point A (see map)
[[Booker]] and [[Alton]] await further implications in the nearby cornflowers. 
[[Keth]] tries to communicate with the 3 kobolds on guard, but fails miserably. One of the kobolds fires their bow.

```ad-combat

After murdering a dozen or so kobolds we investigate the second island (Point B)
On this island the nest/hive lays
An attempt to make them look like houses was not very successful.
