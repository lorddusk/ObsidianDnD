## Summary of This Session:
Op het festival aangekomen, de kraampjes afgegaan, spelletjes gespeeld, wedstrijden bezocht.
Tegen het einde van de avond een aanval van kobolds rijdend op wespen.
Dit afgeslagen met minieme schade opgelopen te hebben, een van de kobolds in leven gelaten.
Deze ondervraagd en daarna vrijgelaten met een kleine safeguard.
Een priest heeft ons gevraagd om mee te gaan, om een crypte te checken waar geruchten over naar boven zijn gekomen, dat er niet ligt wat er zou moeten liggen.

## Notes:
Arrived in [[Nimon Gap]] on a boat.

[[Harvest Festival]] is later in the year than it usually is, because of a heatwave.

[[Alton]] bought a bottle of pear liquor, and a bottle of pale ale in one of the stands.

[[Aelar]] played a game of high-striker misses twice, wins the third time. [[Keth]] had a big laugh over this, and showed [[Aelar]] how it should be done. Succeeded until level 4, unfortunately failed level 5.

[[Bikam]] joined a chili-pepper eating contest, [[Booker]] watched, and afterwards bought the hottest pepper they had, for later usage.

[[Booker]] and [[Keth]] are there through the Adventurers Guild as guards.

[[Bikam]] and [[Alton]] join a competition dagger throwing. [[Bikam]] won with 9 points, while [[Alton]] failed considerably, with only 3 points.

Nearing end of day, guards shout towards us that [[Nimon Gap]] is under attack.
We are attacked by kobolds riding some kind of wasp.

```ad-combat

```

We captured a kobold, and kept him for questioning.
After combat, we find a note on one of the kobold bodies: 
```ad-quote
title: In Draconic, translated through Comprehend Languages
collapse: open
Execute an ambush during the [[Harvest Festival]], so I can do my job uninterrupted.
~ [[Jeralla]]
```

A priest named [[Brother Keefe]] approaches us, while recovering from the fight.
He's the guarding of the cemetery in [[Nimon Gap]], his job is to bury the dead, and keep the records of the deceased. 
He brings rumors that one of the [[Clerics of Kelemvor]] that is buried there, is not really a human, but a disguised Green Dragon.
And asks us to join him to investigate. We told him that we first needed to interrogate the capture kobold (as there are no prison cells in [[Nimon Gap]]) and will join him afterwards.

The Kobold [[Kobob]] works for "[[The Inventor]]" (Kneecap in Draconic), who in turn works for [[Jeralla]]. But currently has no whereabouts of the latter.
They received orders from [[Jeralla]] to attack [[Nimon Gap]]. Originating from an outpost just outside the city in the woods. 
They ride their wasps, because they raised them to be ridden.
We ([[Booker]] and [[Keth]]) marked [[Kobob]] with a small cross under their wings. So that if we ever run into them again, we know it's the kobold we released. Told him that if we ever run into him again, and they were still up to evil stuff, we would kill him without showing mercy again.
