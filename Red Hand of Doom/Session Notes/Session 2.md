## Recap of Last Session:
![[Red Hand of Doom/Session Notes/Session 1#^summary]]

## Housekeeping:
- We moeten gaan rollen in dice trays, de rolls waren behoorlijk goed te horen voor de kinderen.
- Datums voor komende 3 sessies vast gezet.
- Of Joe nog mee gaat doen is nog maar de vraag
## Notes:
Naar de begraafplaats gegaan met Keefe.
Doom Guide : Jovier Glemden (The head priest, and senior of Keefe)
Most solemn order of the silent shroud.
Crypt of Xandria, no traces of magic or burglary found.
Walls carved, and painted with scenes of a human woman, in various locations:
- Snowy Mountain [White]
- Staring in rain with lighting [Blue]
- sitting in a  room behind a fireplace [Red]
- Holding a snake in a garden [Green]
- Working in a lab, with bubbling vials [Black]
- Various other depictions
In the middle of the crypt lies a sarcophagi

After opening the crypt, we saw 5 gems, [Red, Blue, Green, Black, White]
Gas started filling the room.
Stuck those in the opening above the depictions, and stopped the gas. The crypt moved aside and a stairs down appeared.

Keefe looks as surprised as we do. Asked to make noise if anyone enters the crypt, and we move down the stairs.
As a safeguard [[Aelar]] sets a beartrap on the stairs, so we know if someone moves down.

A magical plane was seen, but nothing triggered when interacted with, or moved passed.
It appears to be a door, and we manage to open it. Moving through the door, we got damaged by a necrotic trap (Me and [[Alton]])
We found some notes

```ad-note
Raaksil, I've figured out how to complete to process, put this in a cauldron, and stir the content, the effect will be instantaneous, but don't drink the content
~ [[Jeralla]]
```

```ad-note
Jeralla, the Artificer has been found, his lab is near the abandon watermill near the tweesprong
~ Raaksil
