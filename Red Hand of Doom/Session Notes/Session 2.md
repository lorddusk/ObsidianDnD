## Notes:
Naar de begraafplaats gegaan met Keefe.
Doom Guide : Jovier Glemden (The head priest, and senior of Keefe)
Most solemn order of the silent shroud.
Crypt of Xandria, no traces of magic or burglary found.
Walls carved, and painted with scenes of a human woman, in various locations:
- Snowy Mountain [White]
- Staring in rain with lighting [Blue]
- sitting in a  room behind a fireplace [Red]
- Holding a snake in a garden [Green]
- Working in a lab, with bubbling vials [Black]
- Various other depictions
In the middle of the crypt lies a sarcophagi

After opening the crypt, we saw 5 gems, [Red, Blue, Green, Black, White]
Gas started filling the room.
Stuck those in the opening above the depictions, and stopped the gas. The crypt moved aside and a stairs down appeared.

Keefe looks as surprised as we do. Asked to make noise if anyone enters the crypt, and we move down the stairs.
As a safeguard [[Aelar]] sets a beartrap on the stairs, so we know if someone moves down.

A magical plane was seen, but nothing triggered when interacted with, or moved passed.
It appears to be a door, and we manage to open it. Moving through the door, we got damaged by a necrotic trap (Me and [[Alton]])
We found some notes in this new room:

```ad-note
title: Note #1
[[Raaxil]], I've figured out how to complete to process, put this in a cauldron, and stir the content, the effect will be instantaneous, but don't drink the content

~ [[Jeralla]]
```
```ad-note
title: Note #2 
Dated: Ches 03 1491 DR

[[Jeralla]], the Artificer has been found, his lab is near the abandon watermill near the tweesprong.

~ [[Raaxil]]
```
```ad-note
title: Scribled under Note 2
Experiment failed, portal hasnt opened, Artificer is dead, Ichor is leaking through, we are going to use this to empower our army.
```

In another room, found by [[Bikam]], skeletons were found in a throne room. Throne is made from Mahogany wood
In our room, I look through the books, but don't understand anything in them. 
[[Bikam]] hearing about books, enters our rooms and is able to tell they are magical books for incantations.

A third room is painted like a lair of a dragon. Depictions of Hoards, Cultists, Prisoners that are bound and gagged with apples that are being served.
Four glyphs, that are lightly lit are also present in the room
North, 
South (this one is damaged, and does not give of light),
East,
West 
In the north corner, three bodies lie on the floor. Humanlike, but with dragonlike parts sown unto them.
There is a slight smell of decay in the air.
In the middle of the room, a circle was drawn. Seemingly a teleportation circle.
In the corner of the room, a stripper pole is present with purple glyphs inscribed in them.
Inspiration dice was used for buying paper.
This paper was used to copy the sigils of the teleportation circle.
During the copying, 3 zombies resurrect amongst us

```ad-combat
![[Red Hand of Doom/Session Notes/Rolls/Session 2#^combat]]
```

[[Bikam]] has fully copied the sigils of the circle onto paper after an hour.
