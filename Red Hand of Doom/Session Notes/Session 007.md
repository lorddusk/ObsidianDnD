# Summary of This Session:
Een goede nachtrust, en het inslaan van proviand en wat verdere benodigdheden later, gaan we op reis naar Talar, om in Brindol te geraken.
Onderweg komen we de Mushroom Man tegen, die wat warrig overkomt, maar Keth wat hints geeft wat eetbaar is en wat niet.
Een nacht zonder enige verassingen volgt, met als enig noemenswaardig het huilen van wolven in de verre verte. Dit houden we dan ook in het achterhoofd tot aan Talar.
Eenmaal in Talar aangekomen, tegen het einde van de dag, duiken we een taverne in. Hier zit een groepje boeren te tafelen en het gesprek van de dag te voeren. Keth spreekt ze aan om te kijken of ze ons toevallig naar Brindol kunnen brengen, waar ze mee in stemmen (na enig gesteggel over de prijs).
De trip naar Brindol verloopt soepel en snel, we geven bij de poort aan dat we voor de Guild komen, en we worden na onze tol te hebben betaald door gelaten.

# Notes:
## 4 Marpenoth
After a nights sleep in the Squinting Beholder Inn in [[Nimon Gap]] we set out to restock our supplies for the trip to [[Talar]].

On the road, we find a man rummaging in a bush. He's looking for mushrooms. We call him [[The Mushroom Man]] He picks up several mushrooms, and some herbs. Doesn't bother us much, he gives [[Keth]] some directions what to pick.

[[Keth]] and [[Aelar]] find a place to spend the night next to the road, with a bit of protection. [[Alton]] makes a fire for us to gather around. 
During the first watch ([[Aelar]] and [[Keth]]) a wolf crying can be heard in the far distance.
During the second watch ([[Booker]] and [[Alton]]) also hear this wolf cry. And we have the idea that this is very very far away. Over the night we hear multiple of these cries, as if they are answering each other.

## 5 Marpenoth
We continue our track to [[Talar]] keep an ear out for wolven cries. 
Nothing of importance happend during the days travel.
At the end of the day, we reach [[Talar]].

There unfortunately is no water way back to [[Brindol]].
We check-in into the inn, and make our way to the tavern.
There is a family in the inn, who were said to have a cart that could bring us to [[Brindol]], They ask 5GP for the trip. [[Keth]] tried to haggle for 4GP, but [[Alton]] can no longer watch it and puts up the extra 5SP that was agreed upon. We agree to meet in the morning for the cart trip.

[[Alton]] notices a figure in the corner of the tavern, and approaches it. This figure is not very enamoured by [[Alton]], and tells him their names are Bob and Timmy. It seems like this figure are [[Two Goblins in a Trenchcoat]].

```ad-booker

In the night [[Booker]] dreams. In this dream he sees a mountain range, it's dark, a night like every other one.  On the range fires erupt, the close I get, I see that they are campfires/bonfires. Around these beacons a very very very large amount of shapes and sizes appear, all across the range. Not being able to make out what these are. In the air, bigger shapes appear. And wakes up again.
```

## 6 Marpenoth
We meet up with the farmer man we hired for the cart ride towards [[Brindol]].

```ad-booker
collapse: closed
Once outside [[Booker]] sneakily looks towards the Northern and Southern mountain ranges, but sees nothing.

[[Booker]] has a gut feeling something is different, and tries to summon a dagger, instead of his spear. This goes a lot quicker than usual, and something just feels... off... Not sure what to do with this information, we continue to the Farmer, and board the cart.
```

We reach [[Brindol]] 3 sides are palisaded, and 1 side is on the riverside. The farmer brings us to the gate, and drops us off. Guards check who we are, and what we are going to do in [[Brindol]], we tell them we are here for Guild purposes, and they let us through, after we pay the toll.

We walk towards [[The Adventurers Guild]] to get ourselves debriefed, and to enrol the three party members that are not yet a member.
A black horse, dressed in black plate armour is in front of the guild. The horse bears no mark to which you could recognise it from. It has a golden rim around it's head armour.
