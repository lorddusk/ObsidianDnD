# Notes:
## 4 Marpenoth
After a nights sleep in the Squinting Beholder Inn in [[Nimon Gap]] we set out to restock our supplies for the trip to [[Talar]].

On the road, we find a man rummaging in a bush. He's looking for mushrooms. We call him [[The Mushroom Man]]  He picks up several mushrooms, and some herbs. Doesn't bother us much, he gives [[Keth]] some directions what to pick.
