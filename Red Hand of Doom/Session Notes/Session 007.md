# Notes:
## 4 Marpenoth
After a nights sleep in the Squinting Beholder Inn in [[Nimon Gap]] we set out to restock our supplies for the trip to [[Talar]].

On the road, we find a man rummaging in a bush. He's looking for mushrooms. We call him [[The Mushroom Man]]  He picks up several mushrooms, and some herbs. Doesn't bother us much, he gives [[Keth]] some directions what to pick.

[[Keth]] and [[Aelar]] find a place to spend the night next to the road, with a bit of protection. [[Alton]] makes a fire for us to gather around. 
During the first watch ([[Aelar]] and [[Keth]]) a wolf crying can be heard in the far distance.
During the second watch ([[Booker]] and [[Alton]])  also hear this wolf cry. And we have the idea that this is very very far away. Over the night we hear multiple of these cries, as if they are answering each other.
