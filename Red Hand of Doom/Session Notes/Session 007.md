# Notes:
## 4 Marpenoth
After a nights sleep in the Squinting Beholder Inn in [[Nimon Gap]] we set out to restock our supplies for the trip to [[Talar]].

On the road, we find a man rummaging in a bush. He's looking for mushrooms. We call him [[The Mushroom Man]]  He picks up several mushrooms, and some herbs. Doesn't bother us much, he gives [[Keth]] some directions what to pick.

[[Keth]] and [[Aelar]] find a place to spend the night next to the road, with a bit of protection. [[Alton]] makes a fire for us to gather around. 
During the first watch ([[Aelar]] and [[Keth]]) a wolf crying can be heard in the far distance.
During the second watch ([[Booker]] and [[Alton]])  also hear this wolf cry. And we have the idea that this is very very far away. Over the night we hear multiple of these cries, as if they are answering each other.

## 5 Marpenoth
We continue our track to [[Talar]] keep an ear out for wolven cries. 
Nothing of importance happend during the days travel.
At the end of the day, we reach [[Talar]].

There unfortunately is no water way back to [[Brindol]].
We check-in into the inn, and make our way to the tavern.
There is a family in the inn, who were said to have a cart that could bring us to [[Brindol]], he asks us 5gp for the trip. [[Keth]] tried to haggle for 4gp, but [[Alton]] can no longer watch it and puts up the extra 5sp that was asked. We agree to meet in the morning for the cart trip.

[[Alton]] notices a figure in the corner of the tavern, and approaches it. This figure is not very enamoured by [[Alton]], and tells him their names are Bob and Timmy.  It seems like this figure are [[Two Goblins in a Trenchcoat]].
