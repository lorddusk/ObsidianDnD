```
Giant Wasp + Rider dead.
Rider doesn't seem to have anything of value on them. Nothing that points into attack orders, and most likely just attacked us because we destroyed their hive.

[[Bikam]] went down during combat, and seems to be paralysed because of the poison the wasp injected into him.
[[Aelar]] spend some time harvesting/salvaging the giant wasp.

A short rest later, [[Bikam]] returns back amongst the living, [[Booker]] heals him a bit more.

We move to the island that houses the [[Old Abandoned Watermill]], its walls are filled with sticks, bones, and kobold graffiti. A very nasty smell lingers in the air, it burns a little in the nose. A closed door with in front of it badly created wards and offerings. A stream of red ichor runs through the fundaments of the walls, dripping in to the river
