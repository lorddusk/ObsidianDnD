Giant Wasp + Rider dead.
Rider doesn't seem to have anything of value on them. Nothing that points into attack orders, and most likely just attacked us because we destroyed their hive.

[[Bikam]] went down during combat, and seems to be paralysed because of the poison the wasp injected into him.
[[Aelar]] spend some time harvesting/salvaging the giant wasp.

A short rest later, [[Bikam]] returns back amongst the living.
