Giant Wasp + Rider dead.
Rider doesn't seem to have anything of value on them. Nothing that points into attack orders, and most likely just attacked us because we destroyed their hive.

[[Bikam]] went down during combat, and seems to be paralysed because of the poison the wasp injected into him.
[[Aelar]] spend some time harvesting/salvaging the giant wasp.

A short rest later, [[Bikam]] returns back amongst the living, [[Booker]] heals him a bit more.

We move to the island that houses the [[Old Abandoned Watermill]], its walls are filled with sticks, bones, and kobold graffiti. A very nasty smell lingers in the air, it burns a little in the nose. A closed door with in front of it badly created wards and offerings. A stream of red ichor runs through the fundaments of the walls, dripping in to the river.

[[Keth]] mentions this area feels very desecrated. [[Alton]] opens the door, and we step inside.
On the inside the mill has been ransacked, glass shards, scorch marks, tables are thrown everywhere, it all points to an explosion from the inside of the mill towards the outside. 
In the middle a circle with runes, some of them broken. The ichor originates from the broken runes.

Next to this circle, pipes and an alembic are broken and damaged. Plants have grown significantly and run up the walls.
