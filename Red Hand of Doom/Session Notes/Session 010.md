# Notes:
## 9 Marpenoth
The humanoids that are still on our ships deck are humanoids, blue scaled skin, clearly bi-pedal with claws. Looks are very primitive. These seem very similar to the claw prints we have found in the fields near the farmsteads.

We continue our way along the river towards where we heard the drums last.

Along the coastal line we spot more and more blood trails.
Further along the trail we find a marsh, we continue through the river.
When reaching a crossroads in the marsh, [[Alton ]]is grabbed and pulled from the boat by a Large Toad.
After dispatching 2 of the Large Toads, we find more and more skeletal remains, all halfling size. Bones cleaned by the acid of the toads.

After some debating amongst the group, we decide to continue on our way, and take the middle road of the three-way fork.
