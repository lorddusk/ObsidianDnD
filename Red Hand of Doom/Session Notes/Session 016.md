# Housekeeping:
- [[DM Inspiration]] Dice - Currently left : 3

# Notes:
During the fight with [[Regiarix]] Booker remains in a deep deep sleep.
[[The Benefactor]] appears before him during this dream, Gem of Dark Majesty was found. She says; "find the rest if you want to avoid your destiny."

[[Booker]] and [[Bikam]] make a bet that the dragon might be in [[Rhest]]
(If [[Regiarix]] is in [[Rhest]], [[Booker]] has to give [[Bikam]] 1 GP.)

The well that was destroyed is now, with proper light, actually completely destroyed, and a new well needs to be struck. The whole village is out and about to help fix this.

We arrive after 2 days in [[Brindol]], the adventuring guild is already filled with many people. Where we find [[Reynard Aristaios]] and we discuss the current affairs about the dragon, and what we can do with the dragonbone. Reynard tells us he will find a smith who can forge with this material. 
We also tell him, that for the time being, we will not be taking any new guild quests, and that everything to do with the dragon has a bigger priority for us.

The druid circle near [[Rhest]] might know a thing or two about the dragon, if it actually resides
