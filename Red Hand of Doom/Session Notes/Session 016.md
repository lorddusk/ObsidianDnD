[[Booker]] and [[Bikam]] make a bet that the dragon might be in [[Rhest]]
(If [[Regiarix]] is in [[Rhest]], [[Booker]] has to give [[Bikam]] 1 GP.)

The well that was destroyed is now, with proper light, actually completely destroyed, and a new well needs to be struck. The whole village is out and about to help fix this.
