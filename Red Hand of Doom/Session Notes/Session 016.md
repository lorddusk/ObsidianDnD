# Notes:
During the fight with [[Regiarix]] Booker remains in a deep deep sleep.
[[The Benefactor]] appears before him during this dream, Gem of Dark Majesty was found. She says; "find the rest if you want to avoid your destiny."

[[Booker]] and [[Bikam]] make a bet that the dragon might be in [[Rhest]]
(If [[Regiarix]] is in [[Rhest]], [[Booker]] has to give [[Bikam]] 1 GP.)

The well that was destroyed is now, with proper light, actually completely destroyed, and a new well needs to be struck. The whole village is out and about to help fix this.

We arrive after 2 days in [[Brindol]], the adventuring guild is already filled with many people. Where we find [[Reynard Aristaios]] and we discuss the current affairs about the dragon, and what we can do with the dragonv
