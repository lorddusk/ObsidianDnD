# Notes:
## 2 Marpenoth
[[Bikam]] moved into the [[Old Abandoned Watermill]] after his rest, and started tracing the teleportation circle we found there. He figured out that the portal is not for teleportation perse and is more used to scry into other planes.

The runes on this circle have no literal meaning, but in both Abyssal and Draconic they mean the same.

[[Bikam]] figured out which rune corresponds with the activity of the circle itself, and we decide to remove it from the circle.

In the mean time [[Aelar]] created a brancard from the door and some other materials lying around the mill.
[[Bikam]] decides to check the rest of the mill, and managed to wake some blights.
```ad-combat
collapse: closed
![[Rolls S006#^combat1]]
```

In our rest after combat ( I'M ALIVE!!!!! ), we discuss how we want to deal with the mill. The choice falls upon arson.
By burning up the mill, it explodes, causing debris to fly out and hit [[Booker]] and [[Alton]].

We set up camp for the night.

## 3 Marpenoth
After an uneventful night, we reach [[Nimon Gap]] in the afternoon.

We walk to the Squinting Beholder Inn to speak to [[Crucia Cromwell]] to debrief ourselves from the prior days.
We hand deliver the research note to her, with the map, journals, and the goodbye letter.
She hands us 2 bags, one filled with silver, one with gold.

She also hands [[Alton]], [[Aelar]], and [[Bikam]] recommendation letters for the Adventurers Guild.

Discussing the future with her, she seems very unsure about what everything will do for her and the town, but promises us to keep us in the loop.

After a meal we sleep and make plans to move back to [[Brindol]]
