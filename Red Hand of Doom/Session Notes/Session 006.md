# Notes:
## 2 Marpenoth
[[Bikam]] moved into the [[Old Abandoned Watermill]] after his rest, and started tracing the teleportation circle we found there. He figured out that the portal is not for teleportation perse and is more used to scry into other planes.

The runes on this circle have no literal meaning, but in both Abyssal and Draconic they mean the same.

[[Bikam]] figured out which rune corresponds with the activity of the circle itself, and we decide to remove it from the circle.

In the mean time [[Aelar]] created a brancard from the door and some other materials lying around the mill.
[[Bikam]] decides to check the rest of the mill, and managed to wake some blights.

In our rest after combat ( I'M ALIVE!!!!! ), we discuss how we want to deal with the mill. The choice falls upon arson.
By burning up the mill, it explodes, causing debris to fly out and hit [[Booker]] and [[Alton]].

We set up camp for the night.
