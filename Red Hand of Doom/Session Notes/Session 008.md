## 6 Marpenoth
The [[The Adventurers Guild]] has seen better days.
It looks a bit decrepit, but it holds up.
A sign with [[The Hall of Great Valour]] hangs outside.

Inside the guild, the setup like a tavern, behind the bar stands [[Reynard Aristaios]].
A man, dressed in black dragon leather armour is talking to him. They seem to agree on something, and he walks away holding pieces of paper.

We speak with [[Reynard Aristaios]] about the rest of the group joining up. He introduces himself to [[Alton]], [[Aelar]], and [[Bikam]]. He gives a small speech about what [[The Adventurers Guild]] does in the region, and what we can do for them.
Namely that some of the guild members like to hunt (evil) monsters for materials, parts, food, and trophies.

He gives [[Booker]] and [[Keth]] a bronze tag, as an upgrade over our older ones. He also gives the same tag to the others. This means we move up in the ranking system of the Guild. These tags have a one-time use only function. It functions as an emergency call to the Guild, only one-way akin to [[Sending]].

He tells us, if we choose to accept it, that a new mission is ready for us.
In [[Witchcross]] there seem to be reports of missing persons. He has no accurate numbers of the amount of people missing.
In the Crossing Inn, our contact person resides, and the question is to go see them. [[Romsan Kall]] is their name.
He gives us a rundown what the facilities are in the Guild;
Stables, Identifications, Minor magic item sale, purchase of monster parts/loot, resurrection/healing services, smiths, herbalists, and a lot more crafters are available for requests.

Shopping spree ensues.

We decide to go to the Zombie Inn to see if we might gather some more information about the disappearances in [[Witchcross]]. No-one knows anything, so we decide to go to bed.

## 7 Marpenoth
Nothing worth mentioning happens today.

## 8 Marpenoth
We arrive in [[Witchcross]] after an uneventful trip. And we head for the [[Crossing Inn]], which is in the west of the village.

The disappearances happened a week ago, on the first day of the drums. Those started to happen from the east. Might be as far away as the Twilight Marshes. They happen throughout the whole night, and at the beginning of the day people, with their complete life-stock vanish. 
They have a few clues, riverside people hear stuff from the river and fear that a monster made lair in the river. Others think its lizard folk from the marshes.
A rough estimate is that at least 30 people have gone missing at this time. No specifics about the missing people, they can be any age, any race, any gender.
No people have returned so far.
The last one who called in a disappearance was [[Snorre]] 

Suddenly the door opens, a human male hurriedly enters, looks around and moves towards us. Visibly upset. 
"The family Renon has gone missing, help us!" 

We go to the place where the Renons were last seen, via boot.
