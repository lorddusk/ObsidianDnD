# Notes:
The [[The Adventurers Guild]] has seen better days.
It looks a bit decrepit, but it holds up.
A sign with [[The Hall of Great Valour]] hangs outside.

Inside the guild, the setup like a tavern, behind the bar stands [[Reynard Aristaios]].
A man, dressed in black dragon leather armour is talking to him. They seem to agree on something, and he walks away holding pieces of paper.

We speak with [[Reynard Aristaios]] about the rest of the group joining up. He introduces himself to [[Alton]], [[Aelar]], and [[Bikam]]. He gives a small speech about what [[The Adventurers Guild]] does in the region, and what we can do for them.
Namely that some of the guild members like to hunt (evil) monsters for materials, parts, food, and trophies.

He gives [[Booker]] and [[Keth]] a bronze tag, as an upgrade over our older ones. He also gives the same tag to the others. This means we move up in the ranking system of the Guild. These tags have a one-time use only function. It functions as an emergency call to the Guild, only one-way akin to [[Sending]].

He tells us, if we choose to accept it, that a new mission is ready for us.
In [[Witchcross]] there seem to be reports of missing persons. He has no accurate numbers of the amount of people missing.
In the Crossing Inn, our contact person resides, and the question is to go see them. [[Romsan Kall]] is their name.
He gives us a rundown what the facilities are in the Guild;
Stables, Identifications, Minor magic item sale, purchase of monster parts/loot, resurrection/healing services, smiths, herbalists, and a lot more crafters are available for requests.
