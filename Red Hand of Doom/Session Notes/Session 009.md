# Notes:
## 8 Marpenoth
The Renons are a farmers family (man and woman), alongside the river. Tarou is the assistant for the family, and helps them out on the land. They can take care of themselves if needed. 
A couple of farm animals have also gone missing alongside the humans.

Every night, since a week, drums can be heard in the distance.

After 45 minutes we arrive at the farmstead.  We beach the boat, and make sure it's secure enough so it doesn't drift away.
When walking to the farmstead, we notice a ploughed field, with 3 sets of clawed footprints in them.
Leading directly to the farmstead, moving in a southern direction. The footprints are bi-pedal in origin. Their size larger than a kobolds.

The farmstead is a wooden structure, one of the doors is of it's hinges, with indications of a struggle inside and outside of the building.
Deep cuts reside in the floorings, with blood spatters scattered around. With some investigation, at least 1 person has been dragged through the house, back to the river, through the backdoor.

Following this trail, we find a gravel beach, where a big boat was beached before, trails of blood and claws are scattered around.
We find a gourd wedged in between rocks, with a seemingly poison in it, or at least used to be.

We decide to walk to the other 2 farmsteads in the neighbourhood (albeit they are at least a click away).
Both steads are empty, and similar to the Renons trashed. A bull has some blood on his horn, so it has hurt one of the assailants, and it was shot by smaller darts, three times.

A plan is made, and we take the boat further up the stream, towards the drum sounds.
Moving forward pushing to our exhaustion, but ultimately decide to anchor the boat, to rest for the night.
