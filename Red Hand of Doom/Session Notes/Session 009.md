# Notes:
## 8 Marpenoth
The Renons are a farmers family (man and woman), alongside the river. Tarou is the assistant for the family, and helps them out on the land. They can take care of themselves if needed. 
A couple of farm animals have also gone missing alongside the humans.

Every night, since a week, drums can be heard in the distance.

After 45 minutes we arrive at the farmstead.  We beach the boat, and make sure it's secure enough so it doesn't drift away.
