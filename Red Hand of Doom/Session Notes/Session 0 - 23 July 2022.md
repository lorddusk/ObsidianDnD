## Summary:

^summary
## Housekeeping:
**1. Character Creation**

Dice Rolls: Roll 6 times 4D6 and remove lowest. Dice rolled are in order of Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma. You can swap a roll that corresponds with one or more your class’s main ability score for another roll once. to see your main ability scores, check the multiclassing prerequisites for your class.

Reroll all if no stat is higher than 1x15 or 2x14.

When rolling a new character after character death, the limitation on rolling stats in order is removed.

**2. Sourcebooks:** Player’s Handbook, Sword Coast Adventurer’s Guide, Volo’s Guide to monsters, Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything*, Xanathar's Guide to Everything, Fizban’s Treasury of dragons.

*Tasha’s character creation options are disabled, class options and spells are enabled*

**3. Multiclassing:** Multiclassing is not allowed until further notice or good reasoning from the player

**4. Fantastical/Monstrous Races:** DM discretion. As of now Orc, Kobold, Goblin and Hobgoblin are allowed according to Volo’s Guide to Monsters ruleset

Evil Alignment: Lawful Evil allowed, with stipulations.

- Don’t be Stupid Evil (I suggest playing Lawful Evil)
- Be complex. Maybe you like animals, or are an excellent parent, or value friendship, but also maybe your goal is to be the tyrant lord of Waterdeep.
-  You also - for whatever reason you come up with - trust and rely on the rest of the party.
- No monster races allowed combined with evil alignment
