## Housekeeping:

## Notes:
After breakfast, [[Crucia Cromwell]] approaches us.
She thanks us again for our help, but fears there is more to it than meets the eye.
She says quietly, looking around the room for any eavesdroppers. Asks us to follow her outside, so she can show us something.
Moving around to the back of the inn. A hidden cart under a tarp, under the tarp is a dead, but weird kobold.
The kobold has "Antenna's", a chitin exoskeleton, and their eyes are insect-like. [[Keth]] feels a taint-like demonic energy from this kobold, origination from the [[Gaping Maw]]
