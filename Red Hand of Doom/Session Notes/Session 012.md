# Notes:
## 11 Marpenoth
We plan.
During the preparations of the plan, we hear a dwarf coming towards us, very heavily beaten, and they come out from the water.

[[Aelar]] helps him out of the river.

He talks... a lot...
His name is [[Rolk]]

His brother helped him escape. He was kidnapped by a tribe called [[Dusk Dusk]], one of the 3 tribes currently in a contest. A contest about who can capture the most prisoners. It's supposedly still going for a few days.
They were planning on bringing him to the [[Island of the Lizard King]] in the center of the marshes.
