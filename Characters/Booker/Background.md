## Personal Overview
### Personality Traits :
I honor my deities through practices that are foreign to this land, at at the begin or end of my day I enact a small traditional (for me) ritual.

My deity gave me access to weaponry I never though were possible to be able to handle, and thus I honor her by excessively clean and oil my weapon every day. This oil is a mixture of several ingredients that I think are found in abbundance around my home town ([[Crestbrook]]). The method of cleaning is very detailed and no piece of the weapon is left uncleaned. 

### Ideals : 
I have no clear recollection of my youth, but somehow I remember a ton of little pieces. But in these new lands I woke up in, I keep finding new things to learn and see. Joining the Adventure Guild in [[Brindol]] helped me see even more new stuff.

### Bonds :
Through no choice of my own, I lament having to have leave my home town of [[Crestbrook]]. And thus leaving my parents, and my sister alone. I hope to see them, alive, again one day...

### Flaws :
I have a weakness for the new intoxicants and other pleasures in these new lands. I'll indulge in more than good for me, and have often land in fights, or other altercations with local folk.

Not having a care in the world, going to work, helping out my father on the field, helping my sister and mother out gathering and storing food.
Just figuring my place out in the world, slowly wanting to adventure further and further from [[Crestbrook]]. 

Thinking more and more of leaving, talking to my family and friends. When they told me to just do it. So it's what I did, I gather my things. Grabbed my books, my trusty sword, and a backpack from the shelves. Kissed my mother goodbye, gave my siblings a hug, and started walking...
