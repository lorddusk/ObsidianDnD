## Personal Overview
### Personality Traits :
I honor my deal through a practice that is seemingly foreign to this land. At the beginning or end of my day I perform a small traditional (for me) ritual.

Through a deal I made, I received a weapon I never thought was possible to handle, and thus I honor this deal by excessively cleaning and oil my weapon every day. This oil is a mixture of several ingredients that I were very commonly found around my home town ([[Crestbrook]]). The method of cleaning is very detailed and no part of the weapon is left uncleaned. 

### Ideals : 
I have a clear recollection of my youth, but found myself lost without a way home. In these new lands I woke up in, I keep finding new things to learn and see. Joining the Adventure Guild in [[Brindol]] helped me see more, and hopefully will get me the know how to get back home.

### Bonds :
Through no choice of my own, I have no way to return to my home town of [[Crestbrook]]. And thus leaving my parents, and my siblings alone. I hope to see them, alive, again one day...

### Flaws :
I have a weakness for the new intoxicants and other pleasures in these new lands. I'll indulge in more than is good for me, and have often land in fights, or other altercations with local folk.

## Backstory :
Born in [[Crestbrook]] 28 years ago, a child of [[Titlayo Crest]] and [[Ramose Crest]]. 
Living in a loving family, with 3 siblings. My full siblings: [[Albanus Crest]] and [[Chaedi Lia Crest]]; and my half-brother: [[Eric]].

Not having a care in the world, going to work, helping out my father on the field, helping my sister and mother out gathering and storing food.
Just figuring my place out in the world, slowly wanting to adventure further and further from [[Crestbrook]]. 

Thinking more and more of leaving, talking to my family and friends. When they told me to just do it. So it's what I did, I gather my things. Grabbed my books, my trusty sword, and a backpack from the shelves. Kissed my mother goodbye, gave my siblings a hug, and started walking...

A week later, I was severely hurt in a boar attack, who pierced me on it's tusk. Thinking that I was surely dying, I started praying. I wasn't even a believer of any of the Gods back home, but it just felt right at the moment. I prayed and prayed, nothing seemed to happen, and I felt myself getting weaker and weaker and passed out. Moments later I felt a burning sensation, as if someone set me on fire. I opened my eyes and saw a bright light. A blinding light.

A disembodied voice echoed through the area I was finding myself in; "I can help you, but you will owe me your most precious belonging, something I will collect in 15 years...". 
Not wanting to die, I replied that I accepted these conditions. The blinding light went even brighter, so much I needed to avert my eyes. As soon as it came, it went away. Once my eyes readjusted to a normal light, I felt much better. 

I checked myself, no sign of the piercing anywhere. Although my skin had turned a sort of shade of grey, as if I was sickly, but... I felt fine. 
By my side there was a spear something that wasn't there before. On it there was a note;
"Keep this weapon on you at all times, protect it with your life, cherish it, and it will return the same love to you." on the back of the note was a list with ingredients and directions to take care of the weapon.

Looking around me for the first time, I did not recognize where I was.
I wandered aimlessly around for what felt days, before finding my way to [[Waterdeep]]. Asking people where [[Crestbrook]] was, nobody knew. Not the common folk, nor the librarians. They had never heard of it. 
It became my goal to find my way back home, and I found my way to [[Brindol]] and joined the Adventurers Guild in hopes it would give me the resources to find my way back home...

It has been 15 years now... And I've not heard yet from my "Benefactor".
I'm scared.
