## Personal Overview
### Personality Traits :
I honor my deities through practices that are foreign to this land, at at the begin or end of my day with a small traditional ritual.

My deity gave me access to weaponry I never though were possible to be able to handle, and thus I honor her by excessively clean and oil my weapon every day.
