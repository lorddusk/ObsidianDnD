## Personal Overview
### Personality Traits :
I honor my deities through practices that are foreign to this land, at at the begin or end of my day I enact a small traditional (for me) ritual.

My deity gave me access to weaponry I never though were possible to be able to handle, and thus I honor her by excessively clean and oil my weapon every day. This oil is a mixture of several ingredients that I think are found in abbundance around my home town. The method of cleaning is very detailed and no piece of the weapon is left uncleaned. 

### Ideals : 
I have no clear recollection of my youth, but somehow I remember a ton of little pieces. But in these new lands I woke up in, I keep finding new things to learn and see. Joining the Adventure Guild in [[Brin]]
